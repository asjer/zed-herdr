# Architecture

[Documentation index](README.md)

## Component map

The system is a read-only HerdR source plus a local plugin hint path feeding an editor-independent
core. The only editor edge is the public Zed CLI adapter.

```mermaid

    HerdRSocket["HerdR socket"] --> HerdRClient
    HerdRClient --> WorkspaceSource
    WorkspaceSource --> SyncDaemon

    PluginHook["plugin hook"] --> ControlSocket["control socket"]
    ControlSocket --> NotificationQueue["notification queue"]
    NotificationQueue --> WorkspaceHintSource
    WorkspaceHintSource --> SyncDaemon

    SyncDaemon --> ResolveGit["resolveProject / Git"]
    ResolveGit --> EditorAdapter
    EditorAdapter --> Zed
```

Ownership: [HerdR workspace source](herdr.md), [Service ports](services.md),
[Synchronization core](synchronization.md), [Plugin lifecycle and control](plugin.md), and
[Zed editor adapter](editor.md).

Remote mode keeps the same core on the remote host and replaces only the editor adapter. A local
companion installs and starts the source over one SSH connection, validates its bounded protocol,
and owns the local Zed adapter:

    LocalClient --> LocalZed["local Zed: ssh:// target"]
    LocalZed -->|"success or bounded failure"| LocalClient
    LocalClient -->|"correlated acknowledgement"| BridgeAdapter
```

## Normal daemon flow

The runtime does not derive editor calls from the bootstrap snapshot. S1 establishes protocol
compatibility and subscription ordering; the post-ack S2 snapshot is authoritative.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Entry as index / runCli / runDaemon
    participant Source as HerdRClient / WorkspaceSource
    participant HerdR as HerdR socket
    participant Sync as SyncDaemon
    participant Git as resolveProject / Git
    participant Editor as EditorAdapter / Zed

    Entry->>Source: start scoped daemon
    Source->>HerdR: S1 session.snapshot
    HerdR-->>Source: snapshot
    Source->>Source: protocol validation
    Source->>HerdR: events.subscribe
    HerdR-->>Source: subscription_started
    Source->>Sync: Invalidated(N)
    Sync->>Sync: collapse 50 ms trigger
    Sync->>Source: S2 snapshot(N)
    Source->>HerdR: session.snapshot
    HerdR-->>Source: authoritative snapshot
    Source-->>Sync: WorkspaceSnapshot
    loop every workspace
        Sync->>Git: resolve project
        Git-->>Sync: canonical Git root or skip
    end
    Sync->>Sync: install authoritative cache
    loop unique Git roots in snapshot order
        Sync->>Editor: ensureProject(root)
    end
    Sync->>Editor: focusProject(active root)
```

## Remote companion flow

1. `remote <ssh-target> [--session <name>]` validates option-free tokens before starting a process.
2. The local client hashes the standalone source bundle and copies it to a content-addressed path
   below the remote user's `.cache/zed-herdr/` directory.
3. One long-lived exact-argv SSH process starts that bundle with the optional fixed
   `HERDR_SESSION=<name>` environment token.
4. The source performs the normal S1/subscription/S2 sequence and resolves Git roots on the remote
   filesystem.
5. Its bridge adapter sends only `ensure_project` and `focus_project` requests. The local client
   validates the version, frame, operation, id, and absolute path, invokes local Zed with an encoded
   SSH URI, and returns a correlated acknowledgement.
6. Only acknowledged successes enter synchronization caches; failure remains retryable.

Remote mode supplies an empty `WorkspaceHintSource`, so v1 skips non-worktree workspaces. It does
not tunnel plugin control sockets or modify the remote HerdR server.

## Plugin hook flow

Hook startup first attempts reuse. Only control unavailability enters the locked contender branch,
and any pane opened by the plugin is explicitly unfocused.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Hook as plugin hook
    participant Directory as control directory
    participant Control as control socket
    participant Lock as token lock
    participant HerdR as HerdR plugin pane
    participant Daemon as daemon control server
    participant Queue as notification queue
    participant Hints as WorkspaceHintSource
    participant Sync as SyncDaemon

    Hook->>Hook: decode hook
    Hook->>Directory: validate owner and mode
    Hook->>Control: notify workspace cwd
    alt existing daemon
        Control->>Queue: publish notification
        Queue->>Hints: stream WorkspaceCwdHint
        Hints->>Sync: current-generation refresh
        Control-->>Hook: ok
    else ControlUnavailable
        Control-->>Hook: unavailable
        Hook->>Lock: acquire
        Hook->>Control: re-notify under lock
        alt concurrent winner now available
            Control->>Queue: publish notification
            Queue->>Hints: stream WorkspaceCwdHint
            Hints->>Sync: current-generation refresh
            Control-->>Hook: ok
        else still unavailable
            Control-->>Hook: unavailable
            Hook->>Control: prepare owner-only socket
            Hook->>HerdR: open daemon pane --no-focus
            HerdR->>Daemon: start bun daemon
            Daemon->>Control: bind and become ready
            Hook->>Control: notify after readiness
            Control->>Queue: publish notification
            Queue->>Hints: stream WorkspaceCwdHint
            Hints->>Sync: current-generation refresh
            Control-->>Hook: ok
        end
    end
```

## Cross-cutting boundaries

- Protocol incompatibility prevents a source generation from becoming live.
- Malformed relevant HerdR frames are logged and isolated; an oversized unterminated transport
  frame terminates that connection and enters reconnect handling.
- Unresolved projects are logged and skipped, so they never reach the editor adapter.
- Stale generations cannot install cache state, record success, or invoke Zed.
- Control ownership and protocol failures fail closed; only control unavailability enters startup
  retry.
- Failed editor operations are not recorded as successful and remain retryable.
- Remote frames use fatal UTF-8, exact versioned schemas, a 64 KiB limit, bounded fields, and
  correlated request ids before any local Zed call.
- SSH targets and sessions are strict tokens; remote paths stay protocol data and never become
  command text.

The graph has no reverse editor-to-HerdR call and no mutating HerdR method. Plugin control publishes
cwd hints; it does not change HerdR workspace state.

## Implementation and tests

- [`index.ts`](../index.ts) and [`src/app.ts`](../src/app.ts) compose the runtime.
- [`src/herdr/client.ts`](../src/herdr/client.ts) owns S1, acknowledgement, invalidation, and S2
  transport.
- [`src/sync/daemon.ts`](../src/sync/daemon.ts) owns generation gates and editor ordering.
- [`src/plugin/hook.ts`](../src/plugin/hook.ts) and
  [`src/plugin/control.ts`](../src/plugin/control.ts) own the hook branch.
- [`src/editor/zed.ts`](../src/editor/zed.ts) owns the only Zed invocation.
- [`src/remote/client.ts`](../src/remote/client.ts),
  [`src/remote/source.ts`](../src/remote/source.ts), and
  [`src/remote/protocol.ts`](../src/remote/protocol.ts) own the remote bridge.
- [`test/e2e/daemon.test.ts`](../test/e2e/daemon.test.ts) exercises the normal built-daemon flow.
- [`test/e2e/remote.test.ts`](../test/e2e/remote.test.ts) exercises both built remote artifacts over
  fake OpenSSH commands and a real Unix socket.
- [`test/plugin/control.test.ts`](../test/plugin/control.test.ts) exercises daemon reuse, startup,
  readiness, and hint publication.
